Designed for Windows. This search function uses Google Custom Search which is free but requires a bit of complicated setup.
Once you have established your 'Google Custom Search API' and get a key and cx code you can edit the script and add them.

There is a variable for the number of results that you can adjust as well; 'num_results'.

This function will return a Title, Link and Snippit description for each result.
  
You can then ask the AI to send a specific result to the default system Browser if you have send_to_chrome installed.
