This MemGPT function will send a message to a phone running 'Autoremote'.
(or actually any number of devices that can run AutoRemote such as a Computer(chrome extension, EventGhost), or a Raspberry Pi, ect.)

I think this is an Android only app but not certain.

Autoremote can be found in the Google Play App Store.

You can ask the AI to send anything to your phone, a Rocket launch schedule, a url, a note etc.

In tandem with another awesome Android app called 'Tasker' you can do things like cause a url that is sent to be opened in the phones browser or cause incoming messages to be spoken or trigger something else etc. You can even do something like even have the incoming message enable the 'Do not disturb' feature on the phone. 
Many possibilities including responding to the AI.
