The function checks for the current weather for the specified zipcode at openweathermap.org.

It requres a free API key. Once you have the key you can edit the code and insert it where you see 'YOUR-API-KEY'

There are also two urls that get added to the results. 'radar_map' & 'forecast'. You can adjust these URL's to point to resources that apply to your area.

Once you have the results from get_weather, if you have 'send_to_chrome' installed you can simply ask the AI to open either of the URL's in the default system browser.
