Designed for Windows, This extremely simple function allows the AI send a url to the system and cause the default browser to open it.

This function is mostly mneant to be used with the other search functions I created for MemGPT. Such as 'search_api', 'search_ebay', 'news_api' and 'check_movies'.

When you get results from these functions you can then ask the AI to send the link for result 3 (for example) to 'chrome'. For those of you using other browsers I'm sorry I was focused on chrome when I made this but in my defense it will use the default system bowser. You could always rename the file and edit the code and make it what you want.
