Made for Windows. This MemGPT function searches 'The Movie Database' API (TMDB.COM) and returns results. Links to the IMDB Page for each movie are created automatically.

If you have 'send_to_chrome' installed then you can tell the AI to open a specific result (movie) in the default browser.

Adjust 'num_results' to whatever you desire.

You will notice in the code several items from the JSON list are commented out. They seemed useless to me but I left them for others to decide. You can uncomment and try for yourself.
  
This API requires a free API key from tmdb.com.
