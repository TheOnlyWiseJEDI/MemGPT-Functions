If you happen to live near a Launch Pad or just like to keep up with Rockets then this is the function for you.

This function uses the API from rocklaunch.live to retrieve upcoming launch schedule for the specified area.

It requires an API Key that is not free but is cheap and if you live near SpaceX like I do and want to actually see the rocket
that is causing a simulated earthquake BEFORE it hits orbit it might be worth it.

Currently adjusted for Florida, it's able to support information about launch pads from all around the world.

Edit the file and add your API key and set the desired location. Which you will learn all about when you get a key.
There are also some additional fields from the JSON list you can uncomment if you want the detail.
